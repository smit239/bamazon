Overview
In this activity, you'll be creating an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL and Sequelize skills you learned this unit. The web app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. As a challenge task, you can program your site to track product sales across your store's departments and then provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.
